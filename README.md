# Home-Automation

A place to document my home automation things and store my configs.

I'm using [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) to automate All The Things. It runs as a [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/homeassistant/home-assistant/) on a Raspberry Pi

## Devices being used
- Wemo Switches
- Sonoff Basic switches

## Other hardware & software
[mqtt-door](https://github.com/shmick/mqtt-door/) running on a separate Raspberry Pi
